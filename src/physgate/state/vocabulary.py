"""The quantity names a proposal may use: the gate's catalogue, spelled where a hook can read it.

A role session's proposal is refused at write time when a quantity's name is not here, so
that every relation and range the gate reads by name applies to what the session wrote. The
names are the gate's catalogue (physgate.gate.catalogue.QUANTITIES); they are listed
again here because a hook may not load the gate (pint, sympy and the gate's own modules are
not code a hook is allowed to pull in), and the sentinel's record of what a hook may load
covers this package. A test holds this list equal to the catalogue, so the two cannot drift.
